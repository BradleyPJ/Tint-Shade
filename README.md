# Tint-Shade-Generator

## What is the Tint Shade Generator?

The generator will _currently_ take 1 hex color and out put tints and shades in 10% increments

## Why did i make this

The tint-shade generator was made firstly as practice for javascript as its been years since i wrote any javascript.

I also wanted to use more shades after trying TailwindCSS, and seeing how useful shades of the same color are.

## TODO

- Add Support for Multiple Hex Codes
- Animate Coping
- Validate User Hex Codes
- Add Support to Copy Without #
